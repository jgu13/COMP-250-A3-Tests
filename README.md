# COMP-250 A3 Tests

## Usage
Obviously no solution code here, so you have to put in your own `DogShelter.java` inside `/src/main/java/assignment3`.
Tests themselves run using JUnit, so you just have to run the `:test` task.

## Contributions
Anyone is free to send in a PR with their tests cases! Please make sure they work and **DO NOT** submit any solution code.
